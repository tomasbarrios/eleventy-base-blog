### Recommended books
The financial crisis that started back in 2008 has never ended in reality, it is continuing till this very day, while the reason, the bubble gets bigger and bigger. This whole period from 2008 which at the same time is the period of existence of Bitcoin, should be considered as one event and Robert Kiyosaki ― author of the #1 Personal Finance book of all time in his new book "FAKE: Fake Money, Fake Teachers, Fake Assets: How Lies Are Making the Poor and Middle Class Poorer" is one of the best ways to get informed about ongoing FA reality.
